# Anemia Detector

## Project Overview

The Anemia Detector is a machine learning-based project designed to detect anemia by analyzing images of the eye conjunctiva. By leveraging image pixel values, the goal is to provide a non-invasive method for diagnosing anemia.

## Project Status

This project is currently in development. The model is not yet performing optimally due to a limited dataset, which affects its accuracy and reliability. Future iterations will focus on obtaining more data and improving the model's performance.

## Methodology

### Data Collection

- **Image Data**: Collect images of eye conjunctiva to analyze pixel values for anemia detection.

### Machine Learning Model

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Process the collected images to extract relevant features and prepare them for training.
2. **Model Training**: Train machine learning models on the preprocessed data to detect signs of anemia.
3. **Evaluation**: Assess the model's performance and identify areas for improvement.

## Challenges

- **Limited Dataset**: The current dataset is insufficient for training a highly accurate model. More data is needed to enhance the model's performance.
- **Model Performance**: Due to the limited data, the model is not performing as expected. Ongoing efforts are focused on improving the model through data augmentation and optimization techniques.

## Future Work

- **Data Augmentation**: Increase the dataset size by collecting more images and using data augmentation techniques to enhance model training.
- **Model Optimization**: Experiment with different machine learning algorithms and hyperparameter tuning to improve accuracy.
- **Validation**: Conduct rigorous testing to validate the model's performance on new and diverse datasets.
